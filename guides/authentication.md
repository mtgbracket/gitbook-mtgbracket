  The mtgbracket API is authenticated using Bearer tokens generated by OAuth 2.0
  workflows.

# Authentication

In most cases, you will be required to include a valid OAuth 2.0 Bearer token whenever you make a request to the _mtgbracket_ API.  These tokens are generated by your users, whenever they sign in to your application through the _mtgbracket_ OAuth 2.0 web client.

Authenticating an API will require you to include a HTTP Authentication header that includes a valid token.

```http
Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Tokens generated by your application will have specific privileges defined when you register your application.  These include:

* User
* Deck
* Event
* Organization

Each of the above resources will allow for independent control of `READ` and/or `WRITE` access.
