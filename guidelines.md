# Guidelines

## Introduction

The _mtgbracket_ API was designed to empower developers \(and other dreamers\) to build exciting tools and apps around our favourite game.  We hope to build on the foundations started by our peers and provide a full service solution that is valuable for both our users and your own.

Our API is open to the public and completely free to use.  We do however, enforce some restrictions on that usage in terms of rate-limiting and authentication.  We'll discuss those restrictions and other general guidelines on what the _mtgbracket_ API should \(and should not\) be used for below.
